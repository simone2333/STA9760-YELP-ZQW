# STA9760-YELP-ZQW

In this project, I use Spark Cluster on AWS EMR to load data and perform analysis on Yelpâ€™s Reviews and Businesses dataset (about 10gb) from Kaggle and run the analysis via Jupyter Notebook.
I push the data into a publis s3 bucket.

Part I: Installation and Initial Setup
I imported necessary libraries such as pandas and matplotlib and load my dataset as a pyspark dataframe so that I could use SQL to query data.

Part II: Analyzing Categories
I broken down the categories that are associated with each business and found basic statistics on different categories.

Part III: Do Yelp Reviews Skew Negative?
I found the skewness to the overall business rating, which is insighful for a platform such as YELP.

Part IV: Should the Elite be Trusted? (Or, some other analysis of your choice)
